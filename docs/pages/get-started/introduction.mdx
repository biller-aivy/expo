## Welcome! <HelloWave />

Expo is framework that makes developing Android and iOS apps easier. Our framework provides file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much more. Expo is open source with an active community on [GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo) and [Discord](https://chat.expo.dev).

We also make [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas), a set of services that complement the Expo framework in each step of the development process.
