<Example />

Letâ€™s set up a local development environment for running your project on Android and iOS.

## Where would you like to develop?

We recommend using a real device to develop, since you'll get to see exactly what your users will see.

- Android device
- iOS device
- Android Emulator
- iOS simulator

## How would you like to develop?

We recommend development builds. A development build is a build of your app that includes Expo's developer tools. Expo Go is a sandbox for trying out Expo quickly.

- Development build
- Expo Go

{/* So, we need some radio buttons for each of the choices above. Each radio button should add a URL param so that you can link to a specific part of this page. Probably: /get-started/set-up-your-environment?device=physical&platform=android&mode=development Then we can have a section for each of the choices above. */}

{/* Vercel asks you to make an account in their tutorial, you just don't need to immediately to get started. There could be another query param that is like buildEnv local or EAS */}
