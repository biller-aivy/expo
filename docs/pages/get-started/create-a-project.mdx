import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

System requirements:

- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- macOS, Windows (Powershell and WSL 2), and Linux are supported.

We recommend creating a project with the default project template, which includes example code to help get you started. To create a new project, run the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app@latest']} />

> You can use another template by adding the `--template` flag.

## Next steps

You have a project. Now it's time to set up your development environment so that you can start developing.
