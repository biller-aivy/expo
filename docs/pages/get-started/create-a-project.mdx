import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

Create a project with:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx create-expo-app@latest']} />

> You can use another template by adding the `--template` flag.

The default project includes:

- [Navigation](/router/introduction/)
- [Themes](/develop/user-interface/color-themes)
- [Animations](/develop/user-interface/animation/)
- [Unit tests](/develop/unit-testing)
- [Fonts](/develop/user-interface/fonts/)
- [Images](/versions/latest/sdk/image/)

Here’s an overview of the project’s structure:

- **app/**
  - The files inside the **app** diretory create the app’s [navigation](link to navigation).
- **assets**
  - The **assets** folder contains **adaptive-icon.png** used for Android and an **icon.png** used for iOS as an app icon. It also contains **splash.png** which is an image for the project's splash screen and a **favicon.png** if the app runs in a browser.
- **components**
  - Contains React Native components, like **ThemedText.tsx**, which creates text elements that use the app’s color scheme in light and dark mode.
- **constants**
  - Contains **Colors.ts**, which contains a list of color values throughout the app.
- **hooks**
  - Contains [React Hooks](link), which allows sharing common behavior between components.
- **scripts**
  - Contains **reset-project.js**, which can be run with `npx run reset-project`. This script will move the **app** directory to **app-example**, and create a new **app** directory with an **index.tsx** file.
- **app.json**
  - Contains configuration options for the project. These options change the behavior of your project while developing, building, submitting, and updating your app.
- **babel.config.js**
  - Applies the babel-preset-expo preset that extends the default React Native preset and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed. You can also modify this file to add additional Babel plugins or presets.
- **package.json**
  - The **package.json** file contains the project's dependencies, scripts and metadata. Anytime a new dependency is added to your project, it will be added to this file.
- **tsconfig.json**
  - Contains the rules that TypeScript will use to enforce type safety throughout the project.
