### babel.config.js

Applies the [babel-preset-expo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-expo) preset that extends the default React Native preset and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed. You can also modify this file to add additional Babel plugins or presets.
